Yardi Data Migration System
Overview

A professional solution for migrating property management data to Yardi platforms. Handles full migration lifecycle from CRP to production with validation, error handling, and rollback capabilities.
Key Features

    Three-Phase Migration: CRP → UAT → Production

    Delta Processing: Migrate only changed records

    Production Safety: Rollback system & dual confirmation

    Validation Framework: Data quality checks at each stage

    Automatic Encoding Detection: Handles various file formats

    Reconciliation Reports: Data integrity verification

Prerequisites

    Python 3.9+

    Required packages: pandas, pyyaml, chardet

bash

pip install pandas pyyaml chardet

Execution Workflow
Diagram
Code
Getting Started
1. Configuration Setup

Create YAML config files in config/ directory:
yaml

# config/dm1_crp.yaml
phase: dm1_crp
modules: [leasing, ar, fixed_assets]

field_mappings:
  leasing:
    property_id: PropertyID
    lease_ref: LeaseReference
    tenant_id: TenantID
    lease_start: LeaseCommencementDate

validation_rules:
  leasing:
    required: [PropertyID, LeaseReference, TenantID]
    positive_values: [BaseRent]

2. Prepare Source Data

Organize CSV files in the following structure:
text

data/sources/
├── dm1_crp/          # CRP: Representative properties
│   ├── leasing.csv
│   ├── ar.csv
│   └── fixed_assets.csv
├── dm2_uat/          # UAT: Full portfolio
└── dm3_prod/         # Production: Final data

3. Run Migrations

Conference Room Pilot (CRP):
bash

python run_dm1.py

User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
bash

python run_dm2.py

Production Go-Live:
bash

python run_dm3.py

# Confirmation prompts:
# Type 'PROD' to confirm production migration
# Type 'CONFIRM' to proceed

Key Components
Delta Processing

    Identifies changed records since last migration

    Uses stable hashing for accurate comparison

    Automatic encoding detection for various file formats

Data Transformation

    Converts source data to Yardi-compatible format

    Handles special cases (dates, currencies, frequencies)

    Generates temporary IDs where needed

Validation Framework

    Comprehensive data quality checks

    Required fields validation

    Positive value checks

    Value mapping verification

    Business rule enforcement (DM3)

Production Safety Features

    Dual Confirmation: Two-step verification for production migration

    Pre-Migration Checks:

        Verify all source files exist

        Check available disk space

        Validate configuration integrity

    Automatic Rollback: Restores pre-migration state on critical errors

    Error Notifications: Alerts support team on production failures

    Compressed Backups: ZIP format for efficient storage

Best Practices
Data Preparation

    Use UTF-8 encoding without BOM

    Clean data before migration

    Maintain consistent schemas across phases

    Validate data quality before migration

Testing Strategy

    DM1 (CRP):

        Small representative dataset

        Focus on transformation logic

        Resolve all validation errors

    DM2 (UAT):

        Full portfolio dataset

        Test in UAT environment

        Verify reconciliation reports

    DM3 (Production):

        Final production snapshot

        Execute during maintenance window

        Obtain business sign-off before proceeding

Execution Planning

    Schedule DM3 during off-peak hours

    Notify stakeholders before production migration

    Verify backups before starting

    Monitor system resources during migration

Support & Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Issue	Solution
UnicodeDecodeError	Use UTF-8 without BOM encoding
Missing source files	Verify files exist in data/sources/
Validation failures	Check config/validation_rules
Rollback failure	Ensure sufficient disk space
Log Files

Location: data/reports/

    error_log.txt - Detailed error traces

    production_errors.log - Production-specific issues

    validation_*.md - Validation reports

    critical_errors.log - Phase failure reports

Recovery Process

    Check error logs for root cause

    Fix data or configuration issues

    Execute manual rollback if needed:

bash

python -c "from src.rollback import execute_rollback; execute_rollback('data/backups/dm3_prod_20250705_123456')"

    Restart migration after fixes
